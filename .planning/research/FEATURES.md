# Feature Landscape: Arangetram Planning Marketplace

**Domain:** Two-sided marketplace for Bharatanatyam debut ceremony planning
**Researched:** 2026-02-07
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (based on cultural domain knowledge + event marketplace patterns; web research unavailable)

## Executive Summary

Arangetram planning is a complex coordination problem spanning 10-15 vendor categories with cultural specificity requirements. Unlike generic event planning, success depends on vendors understanding traditional expectations (South Indian cuisine standards, classical music accompaniment, traditional stage decoration motifs) while accommodating modern preferences (contemporary photography styles, hybrid venue options).

The existing app has basic vendor browsing and booking. What's missing: comprehensive vendor categorization with cultural context, budget allocation guidance across categories, vendor interdependencies (e.g., venue capacity constrains catering), timeline planning (vendors booked 6-12 months out), and comparison/curation tools for managing multiple quotes.

Core insight: Users aren't just booking vendors — they're assembling a coordinated team where choices cascade (venue selection determines setup logistics for decorators, musicians need coordination with nattuvanar, photographer needs to understand ceremony flow). The platform must support this orchestration, not just individual transactions.

## Differentiators

Features that set this platform apart. Not expected, but create competitive advantage.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Implementation Approach |
|---------|-------------------|------------|------------------------|
| **Cultural context in categories** | Users unfamiliar with all vendors needed; explain what nattuvanar does | Low | Category descriptions, help text |
| **Budget allocation guidance** | First-time planners don't know typical budget splits | Medium | Show % ranges, suggest allocation by category |
| **Vendor interdependencies** | Choices cascade (venue→catering, musicians→nattuvanar) | High | Dependency graph, conditional questions |
| **Timeline planning** | Lead time varies by category; help users plan booking order | Medium | Show recommended booking timeline by category |
| **AI-powered recommendations** | Match vendors to needs beyond just filters | High | EXISTING (basic) — enhance with explanations |
| **Comparison/curation tools** | Manage multiple quotes, swap vendors, see total cost | Medium | Active milestone |
| **Vendor credential verification** | Cultural authenticity matters — vet musicians, nattuvanars | Medium | Manual verification initially, badges |
| **Package deals** | Common vendor pairings (photo+video, makeup+draping) | Medium | Vendor-defined packages |
| **Checklist/planning guide** | First-time planners need structure | Low | Static content initially, then personalized |
| **Budget tracking** | Running total as categories filled | Medium | Event object tracks selections, calculates total |
| **Review filtering by event type** | Generic wedding reviews ≠ Arangetram experience | Low | Tag reviews by event type |
| **Bilingual support** | Tamil/Telugu/Kannada interfaces for parents | High | i18n infrastructure, translations |
| **Virtual consultations** | Connect users with cultural planners for guidance | Medium | Video integration, scheduler |

### Highest-Impact Differentiators

1. **Budget allocation guidance** — Solves immediate pain ("How much should I spend on catering vs venue?")
2. **Timeline planning by category** — Prevents booking disasters ("Book musicians 9 months out, not 3")
3. **Cultural context** — Makes platform accessible to first-time planners unfamiliar with ceremony requirements
4. **Comparison/curation** — Supports decision-making process (comparing multiple photographers/caterers)

## Anti-Features

Features to explicitly NOT build. Common mistakes in this domain.

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **In-platform payment processing (MVP)** | Adds complexity, liability, compliance burden before validating discovery value | Inquiry-based contact only; facilitate connection, payment happens off-platform initially |
| **Real-time chat** | Creates support burden, users comfortable with email/phone initially | Email notifications for inquiries; add chat later if data shows need |
| **User-generated reviews (MVP)** | Cold-start problem (no reviews initially), moderation burden | Seed with testimonials; enable user reviews post-MVP after user base exists |
| **Vendor bidding/auctions** | Commoditizes cultural services where relationship and trust matter more than price | Show pricing, but emphasize fit and experience over lowest bid |
| **One-size-fits-all recommendations** | Arangetram needs are culturally specific and vary by family tradition | Capture user preferences (traditional vs modern), filter by cultural fit |
| **Fully automated booking** | High-touch, complex services need human coordination | Facilitate inquiry → quote → booking discussion; don't force automation |
| **Vendor self-service reviews** | Vendor might respond defensively to negative reviews, creates conflict | Manual review moderation; platform-mediated resolution |
| **Unlimited vendor listings without vetting** | Quality matters more than quantity for cultural services | Curated vendor base initially; verify credentials for specialized roles (musicians, nattuvanar) |
| **Generic event templates** | Arangetram has specific structure and needs | Arangetram-specific planning tools and checklists |
| **Subscription tiers for users** | Marketplace should be free for users; monetize via vendor side | Free for users, vendor listing fees or booking percentage (future) |

## Validation Questions for Roadmap

Features above assume certain user behaviors. Validate during development:

1. **Do users actually mark categories as covered?** → Indicates existing vendor relationships
2. **Do users compare multiple vendors per category?** → Validates comparison tool investment
3. **Do users allocate budgets by category or think in total budget only?** → Influences budget guidance approach
4. **What's the inquiry→booking conversion rate?** → Determines when to add payments
5. **How long does inquiry→decision take?** → Informs need for vendor response time tracking
6. **Do users book categories in recommended order (venue first)?** → Validates timeline guidance
7. **What % of categories are "covered" vs platform-sourced?** → Influences vendor acquisition strategy
8. **Do vendors want package deals or prefer individual services?** → Determines package feature priority

## Sources

**Confidence note:** This research is based on:
- Cultural domain knowledge of Arangetram ceremonies (South Indian classical dance tradition)
- Event planning marketplace patterns (wedding/event vendor platforms)
- Existing PROJECT.md codebase context
- General understanding of two-sided marketplace dynamics

**Limitations:** Web research tools were unavailable, so findings could not be verified against:
- Current Arangetram planning blog posts or guides
- Competitor marketplace analysis
- Recent cultural event planning surveys
- Vendor marketplace best practices (2026)

**Confidence level: MEDIUM**
- High confidence on vendor categories (culturally validated)
- Medium confidence on budget percentages (estimates based on general event planning knowledge)
- Medium confidence on marketplace feature patterns (standard but not Arangetram-specific)
- Low confidence on lead time recommendations (not verified with actual vendor data)

**Recommended validation:**
- Interview 3-5 families who have planned Arangetrams (validate categories, budget splits, pain points)
- Survey vendors across categories (validate lead times, booking patterns, pricing structures)
- Analyze competitor platforms if they exist (PartySlate, The Knot for cultural events)
- Review Arangetram planning Facebook groups or community forums for real user questions
