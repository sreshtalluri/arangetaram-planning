## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Use Supabase trigger for profile creation | Auto-creates profile on signup, no API call needed |
| 01-01 | Preserve legacy backend URL in .env | Supports gradual migration from MongoDB |
| 01-01 | RLS policies: users read own, vendors public | Multi-tenant security from day one |
| 01-02 | REACT_APP_ prefix for env vars | CRA convention, matching existing .env file |
| 01-02 | Role in user_metadata on signup | Database trigger copies to profiles table |
| 01-02 | Specific error messages for signIn | User-friendly errors for invalid credentials, unverified email |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- Phase 1: RLS policies must be enabled on all tables from day one (critical security requirement)
- Phase 1: Auth migration requires gradual strategy (password hash incompatibility with MongoDB)
- Phase 2: Marketplace cold start requires seeding 20-30 vendors before public launch
- Phase 4: AI recommendation latency (2-3s) requires progressive loading UX
