# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 30

## Overview

This roadmap transformed the existing MongoDB + FastAPI codebase into a Supabase-powered marketplace. The journey started with migrating infrastructure and authentication (Phase 1), enabled vendor supply creation (Phase 2), added user event planning and discovery (Phase 3), enhanced with AI recommendations (Phase 4), and completed with the inquiry/connection flow (Phase 5). Each phase delivered a working capability that builds toward the core value: users discover the right vendors for their needs, budget, and location.

## Phases

**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Supabase infrastructure setup, database schema with RLS, TypeScript types

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Supabase trigger for profile creation | Auto-creates profile on signup | ✓ Good |
| RLS policies on all tables | Multi-tenant security from day one | ✓ Good |
| Groq/Llama for AI (not Anthropic) | Free tier, 6000 tokens/min sufficient for MVP | ✓ Good |
| Hybrid AI recommendations | Database filter + AI ranking balances speed and intelligence | ✓ Good |
| Inquiry-based contact (not direct booking) | Validates discovery before building payments | ✓ Good |
| SECURITY DEFINER triggers for RLS | Avoids infinite recursion in cross-table policies | ✓ Good |

**Issues Resolved:**

- RLS infinite recursion in inquiry policies (fixed with trigger-based column restrictions)
- Vendor event access for inquiry display (fixed with additional RLS policies)
- Duplicate AuthProvider wrapping (cleaned up)
- Legacy MongoDB backend code (removed)

**Technical Debt Addressed:**

- Removed seedAPI export (unused)
- Removed legacy backend/ folder
- Removed unused PlanEventPage.jsx and AIChat.jsx
- Removed deprecated auth.js files
